Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is gasfee and I'm interested in cryptocurrencies, especially Cardano and its native token ADA. <br>
Iâ€™m currently learning to write smart contracts on cardano. I'm trying to set up a new skill beside my studies in electrical engineering. <br>
Maybe at some point my skills are well enough to collaborate on deploying projects/dApps on the cardano blockchain. <br>
