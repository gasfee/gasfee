Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is gasfee and I'm interested in cryptocurrencies, especially Cardano and its native token ADA.
Iâ€™m currently learning writing smart contracts to set up a new skill beside my studies in electrical engineering.
Maybe at some point my skills are well enough to collaborate on deploying projects/dApps on the cardano blockchain.
